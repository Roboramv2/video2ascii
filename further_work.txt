Things to add to this project in the future:
1. Improved speed control (currently faulty) with dynamic duration of output
2. Full color gifs (instead of bg and fg) and themes to select from
3. File size compression without reduction of area of each frame
4. Remove dependence on PIl and lean on cv2 fully
